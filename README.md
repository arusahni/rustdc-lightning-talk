## Rewriting it in Rust (Rust DC)

This is the source material for a lightning talk I gave to [Rust DC](https://www.meetup.com/RustDC/).

## Viewing the slides

While [presentation.md](presentation.md) is plenty readable, if you wish to view it as a slideshow, you'll need to
use [patat](https://github.com/jaspervdj/patat): `petat presentation.md`.
